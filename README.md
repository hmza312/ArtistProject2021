To run the project Clone the Git repositry and run yarn install or npm install. Once it is done, run npm start.
I have used ReactJs architecture because ReactJs is widely used library,
 it provide best architecture practices to make code reusable, maintainable and 
also it will help to improve code readability.I have used DRY approach (don't repeat yourself) which means reusable components should be made seperately in the website. 
Also the styling and the code for our components is separated.
I have good understanding with ReactJs architecture and its libraries, it used virtual Dom which faster to access, thats why i use this architecture in this project.
I have used Ant Design Cards to display Artist details and events details.
I have used Redux for storing state and passing data to child components.
